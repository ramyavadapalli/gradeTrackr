# GradeTrackr

GradeTrackr is a web-based application designed to simplify the process of tracking academic progress. Our primary clients are high school and college/university students who often struggle to manage tracking their grades for multiple courses across several semesters. By offering a user-friendly interface for inputting course details, assignment weights, and grades, GradeTrackr aims to help students stay organized and focused on their academic performance. 

The Gradetrack website will be coded in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The backend database will be Supabase. The framework will be a combination of Next.js, React, and Bootstrap. Other frameworks might be added as needed at the team’s discretion. The team will use Visual Studio Code as the Integrated Development Environment. As for coordination tools, the team will use Trello and GitHub.
